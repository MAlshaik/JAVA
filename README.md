# JAVA... My first programming language ❤️

I still remember writing my first ever Hello world. I was in sixth grade when my dad came in with a brand new (but horrible) dell desktop. This was meant to be a family computer yet it quickly turned to mine. Writing my first Hello World program was a struggle. I had to stare at my keyboard for what felt like days just to find the right key. It was then that I quickly learned how sensitive programming was. Every letter had to be in the exact right spot with the exact capitilization. Here I have most of my java files (the ones that I could find) the ugly and the... less ugly.
